## 🎓 Learning & Teaching Focus
This project is planned and designed with a strong learning-first mindset.

- During the development of this project, the goal is to deeply learn data
  structures by implementing them from scratch in C++ and visualizing their behavior.
- At the same time, the project aims to help students and beginners understand
  data structures visually, step by step, rather than only through theory.

Each data structure will be implemented, visualized, and documented in a way
that makes learning intuitive for both the developer and the learner.

## 👥 Who This Project Is For

- Students learning Data Structures and Algorithms
- Beginners who struggle with theoretical explanations
- Developers who want to understand how data structures work internally
- Anyone interested in system-level programming and visualization

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Linear Data Structures
- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List

### Phase 2: Non-Linear Data Structures
- Tree
- Graph

### Phase 3: DS Visualizations & Learning Enhancements
- Step-by-step operation animation
- Memory representation for each DS
- Complexity visualization (Time/Space)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++ (Core data structure logic)
- WebAssembly (Run C++ in the browser)
- React (Frontend visualization)
- HTML / CSS and prebuilt styling libraries or frameworks (UI styling)
- Git & GitHub (Version control)
